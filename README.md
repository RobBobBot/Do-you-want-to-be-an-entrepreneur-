# Do you want to be an entrepreneur ?

## The background
  This "game" was made for a entrepreneurship education project at school because we thought that doing a simple PowerPoint would be too easy.
  
 ## The "game"
  I'm calling it a "game" because it's not playable and probably we will never finish it. It's suposed to be a tycoon simulator where you manage 
  a grocery shop (you place walls, tiles and objects) and buy stock to sell to customers.
  
 ## The creators 
  I am Acatrinei Robert-Marian and my friend is [Botnaru Victor](https://github.com/VicBVic) and we made this while in 10<sup>th</sup> grade at
  The International Computer High School of Constanta.
